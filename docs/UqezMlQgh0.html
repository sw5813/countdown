        <p class="lead mb-4">Dearest Lionel,</p>

        <p class="lead mb-4">
			Happy 27th birthday! In some ways, it feels like I must’ve known you forever- I got to see where you grew up, I feel so very supported and comfortable around you, and I’ve grown to trust and confide in you more than anyone else.
		</p>
		<p class="lead mb-4">
			Then I remember that just last year I thought you were turning 25, so clearly it wasn’t long ago that I didn’t know some very basic things about you. But I’m beyond lucky and grateful that I’ve gotten to spend the past year learning more about you, growing together with you, and falling deeper in love with you. 
		</p>
		<p class="lead mb-4">
			I never imagined that the smartest person I knew could also be the most thoughtful listener and the perfect gentleman. I couldn’t be more appreciative of all the things you do to show me that you care, whether it’s sending me off at the airport and watching me until I get past security, opening Uber doors for me, or bringing lunch back to your apartment for us to eat together when I’m in NYC on a Friday. When I’m sad or frustrated, you’re there for me and know exactly how to make me feel better. You make me feel like I’m living in a movie- how else could I possibly be with the most perfect, kind, handsome guy who inspires and encourages me to be the best I can be?
		</p>
		<p class="lead mb-4">
			I couldn’t be more relieved that visa issues worked out and that you’ve gotten to start working as a consultant at McKinsey. I know your first two studies haven’t been the most exciting, but after all the networking you did while on the beach, the third one you have lined up sounds super promising! I’m very excited for you and can’t wait to hear all about it :) Frankly, even for the studies you haven’t been terribly enthused about, I’ve enjoyed hearing bits and pieces about them from you, and I very much appreciate your sharing those with me. 
		</p>
		<p class="lead mb-4">
			I’m also glad that you live with such great apartment-mates in NYC. From spontaneously making each other food, to being super responsible with cleaning, to hanging out together, it’s very heartwarming to see 😊 And I appreciate how welcoming they’ve been when I’ve come to visit too! 
		</p>
		<p class="lead mb-4">
			Cheers to the wonderful adventure that was your 26th year- it’s incredible to think of how much you’ve experienced and accomplished in that time- traveling all around Asia, PMing for smart cities at JD, winning a dragon boat competition, running a marathon, getting your second master’s degree (in global affairs!), getting published in the Chinese NYT, moving to NYC, and crushing your first McKinsey study. Here’s to year 27, in which I’ll continue cheering you on, and be (not so secretly) hoping that the year brings you ever closer to me ❤️
		</p>
		<p class="lead mb-4">
			Love,
			Summer
		</p>
		<p class="lead mb-4">P.S. I'm sorry I couldn't be there to celebrate with you in person, so I made this video to send along birthday wishes from afar...</p>
